## Getting Started

To install and start using Inference.net CLI on Linux or macOS, run the following command:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -sSL https://testnet.inference.net/setup-kuzco.sh)"
```

## Versioning and Updating

Inference.net CLI provides several methods of updating including automatic updating by running Inference.net CLI as a systemd service. See "Managing Inference.net with systemd".

### Check Version

```sh
kuzco version
```

### Upgrade the Inference.net CLI to the latest version

```sh
kuzco upgrade
```

## Managing Inference.net with systemd

Inference.net CLI provides several commands to manage the node running in systemd.

### Starting a Worker

To start your node and install it into systemd, use the following command with the `--background` flag, which will install the `kuzco.service` in your systemd:

```sh
sudo kuzco worker start --background --worker <worker> --code <code>
```
There is an optional `--follow` flag also which will output the node logs if run with `--background`

### Checking Worker Status

To check the status of the Inference.net node in systemd, run:

```sh
kuzco worker status
```

### Stopping a Worker

To stop the running Inference.net node in systemd, use:

```sh
sudo kuzco worker stop
```

### Restarting a Worker

To restart the running Inference.net node in systemd, execute:

```sh
sudo kuzco worker restart
```

### Viewing Worker Logs

To view the current running logs of Inference.net in systemd, you can use:

```sh
sudo kuzco worker logs
```
