<Note>
Before proceeding, make sure you have compatible [hardware](/getting-started/hardware).
</Note>

## macOS

### Desktop App

The easiest way to get started with Inference.net on macOS is to download and install the Inference.net macOS app from the [official website](https://testnet.inference.net/download).

Launch the app and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your account and launch a worker.

### CLI

Inference.net can also be run as a CLI tool on macOS. To install Inference.net CLI, run following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://testnet.inference.net/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, [register your account](https://testnet.inference.net/register). Make sure to verify your email to complete the registration process.

Next, run the following command to initialize your Inference.net node:

```bash
kuzco init
```

This command will guide you through creating and running a Inference.net node.

## Windows
Inference.net supports running on Windows in a variety of configurations. You can run the node software as a desktop app, in a WSL container, or in a Docker container.

### Desktop App

The easiest way to get started with Inference.net on Windows is to download and install the Inference.net Windows app from the [official website](https://testnet.inference.net/download).

Launch the app and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your account and launch a worker.

### WSL

Inference.net can also be run on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Check out our [WSL guide](/installation/wsl-setup) to get started.

### Docker

You can run Inference.net in a Docker container on Windows. Make sure you have:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
- NVIDIA GPU from our [supported hardware list](/getting-started/hardware)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register Account">
    Register at [kuzco.xyz/register](https://testnet.inference.net/register)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Email">
    Verify your email to complete the registration process
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Worker">
    Go to "Workers" tab in dashboard and click "Create Worker"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Docker">
    Select "Docker" as your deployment method
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Container">
    Copy the Docker command from the Inference.net Console and run it in your Windows terminal to start the container. The command will look similar to this:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all -e CACHE_DIRECTORY=/root/models -v ~/.kuzco/models:/root/models kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker --worker <unique-worker-id> --code <your-unique-code>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Each worker has its unique ID and code. Always use the command provided in your Inference.net Console.
</Note>

Your worker will show as "Initializing" in the dashboard. This process usually takes 1-2 minutes.

## Linux

Run the following command to install Inference.net on Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://testnet.inference.net/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, [register your account](https://testnet.inference.net/register). Make sure to verify your email to complete the registration process.

Next, run the following command to initialize your Inference.net node:

```bash
kuzco init
```

This command will guide you through creating and running a Inference.net node.
