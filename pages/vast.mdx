### Vast setup

1. Sign up for a Vast account [here](https://cloud.vast.ai)
2. Once signed up, add a payment method.

#### Configure Environment Variables

We're going to add two environment variables to your Vast account:

1. `WORKER_ID`: This is the ID of your worker. 
2. `WORKER_CODE`: This is the API key for your worker.

In the left sidebar, click on the "Account" tab. On the right side of the screen, you will see the "Environment Variables" section.

Click on the "Add Variable" button. The dialog will open:

![Add Variable](/images/vast/add-variable.png)

In the Key field, enter `WORKER_ID`. Back in the Kuzco dashboard, you will see the value of your worker ID as `WORKER_ID=XXXXXXXXXX`. The `XXXXXXXXXX` is the value you will copy and paste into the Value field on Vast.
